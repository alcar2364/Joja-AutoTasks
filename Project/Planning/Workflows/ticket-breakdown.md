## Processing User Request

1. Infer the area to prioritize for tickets from the arguments.
2. Review specs (Epic Brief, Core Flows, Tech Plan) and identify natural work units.
3. Apply best judgment to create ticket breakdown: Consider:

- How to group work (by component, by flow, by layer)
- What dependencies exist between pieces of work
- What order makes sense for implementation Prefer coarse groupings:
- Group by component or layer, not by individual function
- Group by flow, not by step
- Each ticket should be story-sized-meaningful work, not a single function Anti-pattern: Do NOT over-breakdown. The minimal least set of tickets is better than multiple small ones.

4. Draft tickets using best judgment: For each ticket:

- **Title**: Action-oriented
- **Scope**: What's included, what's explicitly out
- **Spec references**: Link to relevant Epic Brief, Core Flows, Tech Plan sections
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first (if any)

5. Present the proposed ticket breakdown to the user. Use a mermaid diagram to visualize ticket dependencies for quick reference.
6. After presenting, offer refinement options (whatever are applicable and make sense):

- Change ticket granularity (combine related work or split for parallel work/ clarity)
- Reorganize dependencies or implementation order
- Different grouping approach (by component, by flow, etc.)

7. Iterate based on feedback until the breakdown is right.
